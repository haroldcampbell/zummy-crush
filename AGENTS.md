## Safety & Scope Guardrails

- Operate only within this repo: `/Users/haroldcampbell/work/ai-experiments/zummy-crush`.
- Do not read, write, or modify files outside this project.
- Do not delete files or directories unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer additive changes over destructive edits.
- Optimize for safety over speed.

## Change Confidence

- If uncertain about a change (especially non-reversible changes), stop and ask for confirmation.
- Avoid irreversible operations without explicit user direction.

## Decision Records

- ADRs and XDRs are non-breakable once accepted; changes require a new record that supersedes the old one.

## Workflow

- Use spec-driven development; link work to a milestone and spec.
- Commit often with small, focused changes.
- Use PRs, even for solo work.
