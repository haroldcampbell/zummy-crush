# Session Hand-off

## Date
2026-01-21

## Milestone / Spec
- M004-S001 Match-5 Power-Up Creation

## Role Used
- Game Developer

## Summary
- Implemented match-5 color-clear power-up creation (exact-5 only) with swap-destination placement and center fallback.
- Added configurable visuals for color-clear tiles and a debug start state for match-5 testing (feature-flagged, default off).
- Rebased onto main after M003-S004 changes; resolved conflicts and repaired tests.

## Completed
- Match-5 run detection and power-up spawn logic
- Power-up selection helper + tests
- Debug match-5 start state (centered), config wiring, and defaults
- Updated spec checklist (Spec reviewed/Implementation complete/Tests added)

## In Progress
- PR creation (git-control tool timing out)

## Next Steps
- Create PR from `feature/M004-S001-agent-2-match5-powerup-creation` into `main`
- Review visuals; optionally set `powerUps["color-clear"].badge.text = "CC"` for clarity

## Decisions
- Power-up spawns only on exact-5 runs.
- Swap destination used only for cascade index 0; cascades use center-most selection.
- Color-clear tiles remain matchable (activation deferred to M006).

## Risks / Blockers
- `git-control/create_pull_request` timing out; may require CLI restart or manual PR creation.
