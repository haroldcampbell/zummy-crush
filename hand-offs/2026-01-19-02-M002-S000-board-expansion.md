# Session Hand-off

## Date
2026-01-19

## Milestone / Spec
- M002 - Core Board Expansion
- S001 - 8x8 Board Layout
- S002 - Void Mask Support
- S003 - Loadable Board Definitions

## Role Used
- Game Developer

## Summary
- Expanded the board to 8x8 with configurable animation timings and comma-formatted score.
- Added void mask handling throughout grid initialization, collapse, and match logic.
- Added loadable board definitions with an index + sample boards.
- Added board logic unit/regression tests.
- Prevented initial matches and improved cascade behavior (bottom-first, no overlap, spawn only when space opens).

## Completed
- Config-driven board sizing and animation pacing
- Timer removal from UI and logic
- Void mask rendering/logic support
- Board index + easy theme boards
- Updated milestone/spec checklists
- Added documentation notes in learnings
- Added board logic tests
- Ensured boards start without matches
- Updated cascade to bottom-first, no overlap, and gated new tile spawns

## In Progress
- None

## Next Steps
- Review board masks in easy theme for desired difficulty

## Decisions
- Use JSON board index to pick the first board at startup
- In-game board selector remains out of scope for M002 (future spec)
- Selection highlight is full-tile color (no outline)
- Tile gap should match board padding for readability

## Risks / Blockers
- None

## Notes
- Board config loaded from `app/assets/config/gameplay.json`
