## Date
2026-01-19

## Milestone / Spec
- M002 - Core Board Expansion
- S001 - 8x8 Board Layout
- S002 - Void Mask Support
- S003 - Loadable Board Definitions

## Role Used
- Game Developer

## Summary
- Expanded the board to 8x8 with configurable animation timings and comma-formatted score.
- Added void mask handling throughout grid initialization, collapse, and match logic.
- Added loadable board definitions with an index + sample boards.

## Completed
- Config-driven board sizing and animation pacing
- Timer removal from UI and logic
- Void mask rendering/logic support
- Board index + easy theme boards
- Updated milestone/spec checklists
- Added documentation notes in learnings

## In Progress
- Persistent automated tests (none added yet)

## Next Steps
- Add a lightweight test harness for board logic (matches + void fallthrough)
- Review board masks in easy theme for desired difficulty

## Decisions
- Use JSON board index to pick the first board at startup

## Risks / Blockers
- No automated test harness yet; regressions may slip in future changes

## Notes
- Board config loaded from `app/assets/config/gameplay.json`
