# XDRs (Experience Decision Records)

Intent: Record key experience decisions that affect player feel, pacing, and perception (distinct from technical ADRs).

This document will hold:
- Decision context and motivation (player experience)
- Alternatives considered
- Decision outcome and expected effect on feel
- Validation notes (playtest findings)

Status: Placeholder. Begin when experience-level decisions become frequent.
