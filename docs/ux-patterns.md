# UX Patterns

Intent: Capture and standardize UX patterns that make the game feel consistent and high quality across screens and interactions.

This document will hold:
- Interaction patterns (tap, drag, swap, invalid move feedback)
- Animation and feedback timing guidelines
- Accessibility notes for mobile (tap targets, contrast, motion)
- Onboarding and tutorial patterns

Status: Placeholder. Populate after the core loop is playable.
